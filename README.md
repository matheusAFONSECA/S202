Undergraduate student in the eighth (8th) semester of Computer Engineering at the National Institute of Telecommunications (Inatel). I participated in a Scientific Initiation at the Cybersecurity and Internet of Things Laboratory (CS&ILAB), where, in the Park Here project, I developed skills in computer vision applied to parking systems, focusing on license plate recognition and vehicle identification. Additionally, I served as a teaching assistant for Physics 1, 2, and 3, helping with practical classes, report writing, and answering theoretical questions. Currently, I am an intern at the Inatel Competence Center (ICC) in the PDI SW department.
