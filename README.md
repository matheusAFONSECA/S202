## Introduction

This repository contains the code and materials developed during the Database 2 course at the National Institute of Telecommunications (INATEL). The main objective is to organize the content created during laboratory and theoretical sessions, as well as evaluation exercises.

## Laboratory Folder

The `Laboratory` folder contains resources and materials used and created during practical laboratory sessions.

### Evaluative Exercises

The `EvaluativeExercises` folder includes code and materials developed for evaluative exercises and practical assessments. Each exercise is organized in subfolders such as:

- `ExercicioAvaliativo1`: Contains materials and code for the first evaluative exercise.
- `ExercicioAvaliativo2`: Contains materials and code for the second evaluative exercise.

### Reports

The `Reports` folder is used to store reports and materials generated during lab sessions, providing centralized access to all documentation.

## Theory Folder

The `Theory` folder contains code and resources developed during theoretical classes.

### Activities

The `Activities` folder includes exercises and code developed during lessons to deepen the understanding of theoretical content.

### Provas

The `Provas` folder is dedicated to organizing exams and related materials.

Undergraduate student in the eighth (8th) semester of Computer Engineering at the National Institute of Telecommunications (Inatel). I participated in a Scientific Initiation at the Cybersecurity and Internet of Things Laboratory (CS&ILAB), where, in the Park Here project, I developed skills in computer vision applied to parking systems, focusing on license plate recognition and vehicle identification. Additionally, I served as a teaching assistant for Physics 1, 2, and 3, helping with practical classes, report writing, and answering theoretical questions. Currently, I am an intern at the Inatel Competence Center (ICC) in the PDI SW department.
